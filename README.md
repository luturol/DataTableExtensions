# DataTableExtensions

A project to learn more about extensions and to solve a problem that I had while working with DataTable.

## Motivation

While working with DataTable, I often had some issues to parse DataRow to my domain object. To solve this I've used attributes to map my properties and use reflection to get the right property which combines with the column name of DataTable.Column and then it would create object full filled with all properties which are mapped from DataTable.

## What I've learned

- Attributes
- Reflection
- Extensions
